### Features (The Challenge)

Users can:  
- üîç Search for weather by entering a city or using device geolocation.  
- üå° View current conditions: temperature, weather icon, and location details.  
- üìä Explore metrics: "feels like", humidity, wind speed, precipitation, AQI.  
- üìÖ Check a **7-day forecast** with highs/lows and weather icons.  
- üïí Browse **hourly forecasts** with temperature trends.  
- üìå Switch between days in the hourly forecast.  
- üîÑ Toggle between **Metric** and **Imperial** units (C¬∞/F¬∞, km/h/mph, mm/inch).  
- üì± Enjoy responsive layouts optimized for all devices.  
- üñ± Experience hover/focus states for all interactive elements.  
- üìç Detect current location automatically (first visit).  
- ‚≠ê Save favorite locations for quick access.   
- üéô Use voice search to find weather quickly(üöß).

## My Process

### Built With
- **Vite** (bundler)  
- **React** + **React Query (TanStack)**  
- **CSS Modules** with custom properties & variable fonts  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  
- Light/Dark mode via system preference  
- **Vitest** + **React Testing Library** for testing

### Keyboard search functionality
The SearchForm component is a feature-rich, interactive input for location-based search. It combines immediate feedback (live search), client-side validation, accessibility features, and GPS integration to provide a robust user experience.

Key Features: 
- Live Search with Debouncing: Provides real-time suggestions as the user types, using the useLiveSearch hook to efficiently query data. The search query is debounced by 500ms to prevent excessive API calls while the user is actively typing.

- Form Validation: Uses SearchSchema for client-side validation of the search input, displaying immediate error messages when invalid input is detected.

- Dismissal Outside: Uses the useDismissalOutside hook to close the live search dropdown when the user clicks or focuses anywhere outside the search input and dropdown area.

- GPS Integration: Allows users to automatically use their current location with the "Locate me" button, utilizing the useGpsLocation hook.

- Speech Recognition: Includes a dedicated button for voice input, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

- Location Context Management: Updates the global application state for the user's current location (city and/or coords) via the useLocation context.

### useDismissalOutside hook
  A React hook to manage the dismissal of components (like dropdowns, modals, or tooltips) when a user clicks or focuses outside of the component and its associated trigger element. This hook is reusable on all dropdowns from search dropdowns to any select dropdown.

### Voice search features 
  - Starts listening when the button is clicked.
  - Automatically stops after 10 seconds.
  - Updates the search query live while listening.
  - Validates the search input using `SearchSchema`.
  - Shows toast notifications for errors and info.

### Error handling
  Used a class-based ErrorBoundary integrated with React Query‚Äôs QueryErrorResetBoundary and useQueryErrorResetBoundary hook.
  This setup ensures query errors and runtime errors are gracefully isolated to their component scope.
  The Retry button in the fallback UI calls both the local ErrorBoundary.reset() and React Query‚Äôs reset() to trigger automatic re-fetching of failed data.

### Testing
  Vitest for the test runner and React Testing Library (RTL) to ensure the hook functions correctly from a user's perspective.

### What I Learned
- Efficient data fetching and caching using React Query.  
- Managing geolocation APIs and permissions. 
- Creating a scalable and responsive UI with CSS Grid and Flexbox.  
- Implementing accessibility best practices for interactive UI elements.  
- Testing react query
- Error Boundaries : Error handling in react query. Catching runtime errors that happen during rendering, and react properly to them by displaying a fallback UI instead.
